# Do not use -mavx512f, gives an illegal instruction error, and if possible, we should find the proper AVX-512 flag for the servers CPU (Intel Xeon Gold)
#-msse4.2 -mavx -mavx2 are specific of the servers CPU advanced vectorial instructions
#-march=native forces optimization of the code as much as possible following the architecture of the processor
